# Standard-Atmosphere-Model-ISA-Calculations
This Python module computes atmospheric properties—temperature, pressure, and density—based on altitude using the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model. Perfect for aviation, meteorology, and aerospace studies, it also includes inverse functions to estimate altitude from given conditions. Simple, precise, and versatile!
